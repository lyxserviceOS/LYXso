Summary:
This PR adds a set of repository maintenance improvements to reduce branch/PR clutter, add CI checks, and provide guidelines for contributors. Changes:
- Add CI workflow to run type-check, lint, build, and tests for PRs and pushes.
- Add workflow to auto-delete merged branches (safe defaults, respects protected branches).
- Add scheduled workflow + script to prune stale branches that match common ephemeral prefixes (copilot/*, revert-*, vercel/*, fix/*), only deleting branches that are merged or stale and not protected.
- Add PR template and issue templates to improve quality of contributions.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md with recommended branch and PR rules.
- Add a branch-protection check workflow which will open an issue if main lacks protection (informational only).
- Add minimal package.json and prune script dependencies to run in CI.

Why:
- The repo currently has many stale/ephemeral branches and revert PR chains that increase maintenance overhead.
- The CI ensures issues are caught before merging and encourages stable main branch.
- The pruning automation reduces clutter while never deleting protected branches.

Post-merge checklist for maintainers:
- Enable "Delete branch on merge" in repository settings (recommended).
- Verify Vercel project settings: build command, environment variables, repository link.
- Mark the 'CI' workflow as a required status check in branch protection for main.
- Review and adjust keep-branches and prune patterns if you want different coverage.

Notes:
- No existing branches are deleted by these changes automatically. The scheduled prune job and auto-delete action will only delete branches after this PR is merged and workflows run with repo permissions.
- All deletion logic respects branch protection and open PRs.
